I tried to learned javascript since March this year(2023) mainly following [CodeLove 愛寫扣論壇](https://codelove.tw/)'s online course and gradually learned HTML/CSS/Javascript basic knowledge.
I finished all the course by May and decided to use all I can to make a web app.
Since I've been using Google Maps for travel planning for many years, making such an app is always what I wanna do.
Also as a newbie I really have no idea of and "proper procedure of developing". I just tried do solve any problem on the way to achieve what I might want, while figuring out what I really want.
The consequence is apparently many repeated work, however I do learned many things on the way.

I have been learning JavaScript since March of this year (2023), mainly by following an online course on [CodeLove 愛寫扣論壇](https://codelove.tw/). Gradually, I acquired a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

By May, I had completed the entire course and decided to utilize my newfound knowledge to develop a web app. Creating such an app has always been a goal of mine, as I have been using Google Maps for travel planning for many years.

As a newbie, I am unfamiliar with the proper procedures of development. Therefore, I simply attempted to solve any problems I encountered along the way, striving to achieve my desired outcome and clarifying my objectives.

Consequently, I ended up performing several tasks repeatedly. However, I did learn a great deal throughout this process.

The following are the tools and resources I used or referenced during this project:

    Vue.js 3
    Vue Router
    Pinia
    Vite
    vue3-timepicker [BETA] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue3-timepicker)
    Font Awesome
    Fireship's [Animated Responsive Navbar with CSS - Plus Other Useful Tricks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biOMz4puGt8&t=590s)
    ChatGPT

Additionally, there are a few things I plan to implement in the future:

    Authentication
    Database integration
    draggable buttons to adjust activity time
    draggable marks on brief map to adjust activity destination
    Add place to journey direct from brief map
    export and share journey
